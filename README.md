# Battleship Game(change it later pls)
This Battleship game was created as a junior project for the subject DSA. Our team chose Battleship as the game to implement because we wanted to challenge ourselves to create an algorithm for the bot player that goes beyond simple random moves.

The game was developed using Unity engine and programmed in C#. We hope that players enjoy the game and appreciate the thought and effort we put into creating a more strategic bot player.

## How to Play
The rules of Battleship are simple: each player places their ships on a grid and takes turns guessing the location of their opponent's ships. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.

Our game includes a single player mode against the bot player. In this mode, the bot player will use a more strategic algorithm for making moves instead of simply guessing randomly.
